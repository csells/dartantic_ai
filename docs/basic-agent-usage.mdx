title: Basic Agent Usage
---

The following shows simple agent usage using the `Agent()` constructor, which
takes a model string.

```dart
void main() async {
  // Create an agent with a model string and a system prompt
  final agent = Agent(
    'openai',  // Can also use 'claude', 'gemini', 'openai:gpt-4o', etc.
    systemPrompt: 'Be concise, reply with one sentence.',
  );

  // Run the agent with a prompt (non-streaming)
  final result = await agent.run('Where does "hello world" come from?');
  print(result.output); // Output: one sentence on the origin of "hello world"
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the `Agent()` constructor which takes a provider
directly:

```dart
void main() async {
  // Create an agent with a provider
  final agent = Agent.provider(
    OpenAiProvider(),  // Can also use AnthropicProvider(), GeminiProvider(), etc.
    systemPrompt: 'Be concise, reply with one sentence.',
  );

  // Run the agent with a prompt (non-streaming)
  final result = await agent.run('Where does "hello world" come from?');
  print(result.output); // Output: one sentence on the origin of "hello world"
}
``` 

## Model Strings

The model string used by `Agent` can be specified in several ways:
- Just the `provider`, e.g. `openai` → specifies whatever the default model for
  that provider
- `provider:model`, e.g. `google:2.0-flash` → specifies a provider and model,
  seperated by a **colon**
- `provider/model`, e.g. `googleai/gemini-2.5-pro` → specifies a provider and
  model, seperated by a **slash**

## Providers
A provider is a Dart type like `GeminiProvider` that knows how to expose model
objects (like `GeminiModel`). When you pass in a model string, you're really
looking up a provider object and a model object for the agent to do its work.

You can see the list of [Supported Providers](/supported-providers) that
Dartantic exposes. And you can see build your own [Custom
Providers](/custom-providers) if you like.

## Provider Aliases

Some providers support multiple provider prefixes. The alias can be used where
the provider name is specified, e.g. `gemini:gemini-2.0-flash` →
`google:gemini-2.0-flash`. Here's where you can see the list of aliases for each
of the  [Supported Providers](/supported-providers).
