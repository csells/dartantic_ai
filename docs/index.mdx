## Quick Start

Get started with dartantic_ai in just a few lines of code:

```dart
void main() async {
  // Create an agent with a model string and a system prompt
  final agent = Agent(
    'openai',  // Can also use 'openai:gpt-4o' or 'openai/gpt-4o'
    systemPrompt: 'Be concise, reply with one sentence.',
  );

  // Run the agent with a prompt (non-streaming)
  final result = await agent.run('Where does "hello world" come from?');
  print(result.output); // Output: one sentence on the origin of "hello world"
}
```
