The [dartantic_ai package](https://pub.dev/packages/dartantic_ai) is an agent
framework inspired by pydantic-ai and designed to make building client and
server-side apps in Dart with generative AI easier and more fun!

## Why Dartantic?

Dartantic was born out of frustration with not being able to easily use
generative AI in my Dart and Flutter apps without doing things in a very
different way based on the model I chose and the type of app I was building,
i.e. GUI, CLI or server-side. It's all Dart -- why can't I use all the models
with a single API across all the apps?

As an example of the kinds of apps that I wanted to build, consider
[CalPal](https://github.com/csells/calpal), a Flutter app that uses Dartantic to
build an agentic workflow for managing a user's calendar. Check out this
screenshot:

action" />

In about ~300 LOC, CalPal is able to figure out the events in my schedule based
on an English phrase. To do this, it first has to figure out the local date and
time to understand what "today" means anyway and then uses the result of that
against the Zapier MCP server connected to my Google Calendar.

That multi-step tool usage is all built into Dartantic and it's what makes it an
"agentic" framework.

Oh, and then just for fun, I asked CalPal to add a calendar event to my calendar
based on a picture of the events at my local pool. I can't imagine the
person-years of effort that would've been required to build this without
generative AI, but I couldn't rest until I had that kind of power for all my
Dart and Flutter apps.

Combine that with [pydantic-ai](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) for inspiration and
Dartantic was born.

Enjoy!

## What is Dartantic AI?

One API, multiple provider configurations out of the box:
- **6 native implementations**: OpenAI, OpenAI Responses, Google (Gemini),
  Anthropic (Claude), Mistral, Ollama
- **5 OpenAI-compatible**: OpenRouter, Together AI, Cohere, Google-OpenAI,
  Ollama-OpenAI
- **Chat + Embeddings**: OpenAI, OpenAI Responses, Google, Mistral, Cohere all
  support both
- **Thinking metadata + server-side tools**: OpenAI Responses exposes reasoning
  text and provider-hosted tools today

Switch providers with one line of code. All models. Single API. Enjoy!

## Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  dartantic_ai: ^VERSION
```

## Quick Examples

### Basic Chat
```dart
import 'package:dartantic_ai/dartantic_ai.dart';

final agent = Agent('claude'); // or 'openai', 'gemini', etc.
final result = await agent.send('Hello!');
print(result.output);
```

### Streaming
```dart
await for (final chunk in agent.sendStream('Tell me a story')) {
  stdout.write(chunk.output);
}
```

### Tools
```dart
final weatherTool = Tool(
  name: 'get_weather',
  description: 'Get weather for a location',
  inputSchema: JsonSchema.object({
    'location': JsonSchema.string(),
  }),
  onCall: (args) async => {'temp': 72, 'condition': 'sunny'},
);

final agent = Agent('openai', tools: [weatherTool]);
final result = await agent.send("Weather in Seattle?");
```

### Embeddings
```dart
final agent = Agent('openai');
final embed = await agent.embedQuery('Hello world');
print(embed.embeddings.length); // 1536
```

### Multi-Provider Conversations
```dart
final history = <ChatMessage>[];

// Start with Gemini
final gemini = Agent('google');
final result1 = await gemini.send('Hi, I\'m Alice', history: history);
history.addAll(result1.messages);

// Switch to Claude
final claude = Agent('anthropic');
final result2 = await claude.send('What\'s my name?', history: history);
print(result2.output); // "Your name is Alice"
```

## Key Features

- **Unified API**: Same code for all providers
- **Agent-Based**: Automatic tool execution and state management
- **Multi-Provider**: Share conversations between providers
- **Streaming**: Real-time responses
- **Tools**: Extend with custom functions
- **Typed Output**: Get structured data back
- **Embeddings**: Vector operations with same Agent
- **MCP Support**: Connect to external tools
