title: Provider & Model Discovery
---

Dartantic supports discovering the available providers that Dartantic supports
and the models that are available from each provider.

## Available Providers

You can list the available providers using the `Agent.providers` property. The
result is a map of provider names to provider factory functions.

## Available Models

You can list the available models from a provider using the
`Provider.listModels()` method. This returns a list of `ModelInfo` objects,
which include the model name, what kinds of operations it supports, and whether
it's a stable production model or a preview/experimental model. For example:

```dart
import 'package:dartantic_ai/dartantic_ai.dart';

void main() async {
  final provider = Agent.providerFor('openai');
  final models = await provider.listModels();

  for (final model in models) {
    final status = model.stable ? 'stable' : 'preview';
    print('${model.providerName}:${model.name} [$status] (${model.kinds})');
  }
}
```

### Model Stability Detection

The `stable` field helps you distinguish between production-ready models and
experimental ones. For example:

- **Stable models**: `gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, `text-embedding-3-large`
- **Preview/experimental models**: `gpt-4-turbo-preview`, `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`, `o1-preview`

Until there's an API from the model providers (I'm looking at you, Google and
OpenAI), models are classified using heuristics based on their names, looking
for patterns like "preview", "experimental", "latest", version numbers, and date
suffixes. Please take this information with a grain of salt.

For a working example, take a look at
[list_models.dart](https://github.com/csells/dartantic_ai/blob/main/example/bin/list_models.dart).
