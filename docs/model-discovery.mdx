# Model Discovery

dartantic_ai supports discovering available models from providers using the
`listModels()` method. This returns information about each model including its
name, what kinds of operations it supports, and whether it's a stable production
model or a preview/experimental model.

```dart
import 'package:dartantic_ai/dartantic_ai.dart';

void main() async {
  final provider = Agent.providerFor('openai');
  final models = await provider.listModels();

  for (final model in models) {
    final status = model.stable ? 'stable' : 'preview';
    print('${model.providerName}:${model.name} [$status] (${model.kinds})');
  }
}
```

## Model Stability Detection

The `stable` field helps you distinguish between production-ready models and
experimental ones:

- **Stable models**: `gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, `text-embedding-3-large`
- **Preview/experimental models**: `gpt-4-turbo-preview`, `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`, `o1-preview`

Until there's an API from the model providers (I'm looking at you, Google and OpenAI),
models are classified using heuristics based on their names, looking for patterns
like "preview", "experimental", "latest", version numbers, and date suffixes.

For a working example, take a look at [list_models.dart](../example/bin/list_models.dart).
