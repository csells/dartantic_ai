description: "Real apps built with Dartantic."

The `samples/` folder contains complete applications demonstrating Dartantic in
action. These aren't toy examples; they're functional tools you can use and
extend.

## [Dartantic CLI](/dartantic-cli)

A full-featured command-line interface for the Dartantic framework. Think of it
as `curl` for AI: scriptable, composable, and ready for shell pipelines.

**Key features:**
- Multiple commands: chat, generate, embed, models
- Custom agents via settings file
- DotPrompt templates with variable substitution
- MCP server integration
- Structured JSON output with schemas

```bash
dartantic -p "What is 2+2?"
dartantic -a anthropic -p "Explain recursion"
dartantic generate --mime image/png -p "A robot logo"
dartantic embed create docs/*.txt > index.json
```

## [Chatarang](/chatarang)

An interactive REPL chat application with multi-provider support and tool
calling. Perfect for exploring what AI can do when given real capabilities.

**Key features:**
- Switch providers mid-conversation
- Built-in tools: weather, location, web fetch
- Slash commands for app control
- Conversation history with tool visibility

```
You: what's the weather at the moda center?
Tool.call: location-lookup({"location": "Moda Center, Portland"})
Tool.call: weather({"zipcode": "97240"})
google:gemini-2.0-flash: It's currently 55°F with light rain.
```

## Patterns

These samples show two different patterns:

- **Dartantic CLI**: Non-interactive, scriptable, single-turn. Great for
  automation, shell scripts, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Chatarang**: Interactive REPL with multi-turn conversations. Great for
  exploration and debugging.

Both use the same underlying Dartantic framework, so the skills transfer
directly to building your own applications.

## Next Steps

- [Quick Start](/quick-start) - Get the framework running
- [Tool Calling](/tool-calling) - Build your own tools
- [MCP Support](/mcp-support) - Connect to external tool servers
