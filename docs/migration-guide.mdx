# Migration Guide

## Migrating from 0.9.6 to 0.9.7

### Breaking Change: DataPart.file â†’ DataPart.stream

The `DataPart.file` constructor has been **removed** and replaced with
`DataPart.stream` for file and image attachments. This change was made to enable
compatibility with web and WASM platforms, where direct file access is not
available.

#### What you need to do
- **Replace** all usages of `DataPart.file(File(...))` with `await
  DataPart.stream(file.openRead(), name: file.path)`.
- Always provide a `name` argument for best results (especially for web/WASM).

#### Before (0.9.6 and earlier)
```dart
final file = File('bio.txt');
final part = await DataPart.file(file);
```

#### After (0.9.7 and later)
```dart
final file = File('bio.txt');
final part = await DataPart.stream(file.openRead(), name: file.path);
```

#### Why?
- This approach works on all Dart platforms, including web and WASM, by using
  streams instead of direct file APIs.
- It also makes it easier to support file uploads from sources other than the
  local filesystem.
