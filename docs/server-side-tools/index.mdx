title: Server-Side Tools
description: "Use provider-hosted capabilities such as web search, code execution, and image creation without writing local tool handlers."
---

Server-side tools run entirely on the provider's infrastructure. They stream
progress events, produce final deliverables, and keep your application logic
focused on orchestration instead of implementation. Currently, **OpenAI
Responses** is the only built-in provider that implements server-side tools.
When other providers adopt similar features, they'll be exposed from the
providers as appropriate.

## Enabling Tools

```dart
final agent = Agent(
  'openai-responses',
  chatModelOptions: const OpenAIResponsesChatModelOptions(
    serverSideTools: {
      OpenAIServerSideTool.webSearch,
      OpenAIServerSideTool.fileSearch,
    },
  ),
);
```

Pick the tools you want per request. Providers default to their own safe
configuration if you omit the set.

## Streaming Metadata

Each tool streams structured metadata under a predictable key:

| Tool | Metadata key |
|------|--------------|
| Web search | `metadata['web_search']` |
| File search | `metadata['file_search']` |
| Image generation | `metadata['image_generation']` |
| Code interpreter | `metadata['code_interpreter']` |

Metadata is delivered on every `ChatResult` during streaming, which you can use
to show live progress, log it, or feed it into analytics.

```dart
await for (final chunk in agent.sendStream('Recent Dart news?')) {
  final searchEvents = chunk.metadata['web_search'] as List?;
  if (searchEvents != null) {
    for (final event in searchEvents) {
      stdout.writeln('stage: ${event['type']}');
    }
  }
}
```

## Message Content

Final deliverables (images, generated files, synthesized summaries) arrive as
normal message parts so you can handle them with the usual `ChatMessage` APIs.

## Configuration Blocks

Each tool exposes an optional configuration object:

```dart
final agent = Agent(
  'openai-responses',
  chatModelOptions: OpenAIResponsesChatModelOptions(
    serverSideTools: const {OpenAIServerSideTool.webSearch},
    webSearchConfig: const WebSearchConfig(
      contextSize: WebSearchContextSize.high,
      followupQuestions: true,
    ),
  ),
);
```

Configuration objects are provider-specific today but live under the generic
API surface, so additional providers can add their own implementations later.
