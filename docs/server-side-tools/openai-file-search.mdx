title: OpenAI File Search
description: "Search provider-hosted files and vector stores without leaving the chat flow."

The OpenAI Responses provider exposes a file search tool that allows you to
search through files and vector stores hosted by OpenAI.

## Enable File Search

The file search tool can be enabled via the `chatModelOptions` parameter of the
`Agent` constructor.

```dart
final agent = Agent(
  'openai-responses',
  chatModelOptions: OpenAIResponsesChatModelOptions(
    serverSideTools: const {OpenAIServerSideTool.fileSearch},
    fileSearchConfig: const FileSearchConfig(
      maxResults: 5,
      vectorStoreIds: ['vs_123'],
    ),
  ),
);
```

When `fileSearchConfig.vectorStoreIds` is supplied, the provider restricts
searches to those stores. You can also omit the list and rely on the provider's
defaults.

## Streaming Events

Results stream under the `file_search` metadata key:

```dart
await for (final chunk in agent.sendStream(prompt)) {
  final events = chunk.metadata['file_search'] as List?;
  if (events == null) continue;

  for (final event in events) {
    switch (event['type']) {
      case 'response.file_search_call.started':
        stdout.writeln('🔍 searching ${event['query']}');
      case 'response.file_search_call.result':
        stdout.writeln('- ${event['document']['filename']}');
    }
  }
}
```

Typical fields include `query`, `document`, `score`, and provider-specific
metadata that you can surface in your UI.

## Vector Store Bootstrap

The OpenAI Responses example repo includes a helper that uploads wiki docs and
creates a reusable vector store:

```dart
final vectorStoreId = await setupVectorStore([
  '../../../wiki/Server-Side-Tools-Tech-Design.md',
  '../../../wiki/Message-Handling-Architecture.md',
]);
```

See the sample below for the full workflow, including caching the vector store
ID on disk so you do not re-upload files every run.
