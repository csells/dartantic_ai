title: Server-Side Tools
description: Enable and observe provider-native tools (e.g., OpenAI Responses built-ins) with a single switch.
---

Server-side tools are capabilities executed by the provider (not your app). Examples include web search, file/document search, browser/desktop control, image generation, and code interpreter. When enabled, the model decides when to use them, the provider runs them, and results appear in the streaming response.

Key benefits

- Zero hosting: No code to run or maintain for these tools.
- Lower latency: Single round-trip; results stream as they’re produced.
- Rich signals: Structured SSE events and media deltas.

Enable server-side tools (OpenAI Responses)

```dart
import 'package:dartantic_ai/dartantic_ai.dart';

final agent = Agent(
  'openai-responses:gpt-4o',
  chatModelOptions: const OpenAIResponsesChatOptions(
    serverSideTools: {OpenAIServerSideTool.webSearch, OpenAIServerSideTool.imageGeneration},
  ),
);
```

Observing usage in metadata

When tools are used, the stream carries metadata-only events so you can drive UI, telemetry, or governance without interfering with the model flow.

```dart
await for (final chunk in agent.sendStream('What happened at WWDC 2024?')) {
  if (chunk.output.isNotEmpty) stdout.write(chunk.output);

  // Optional observability hooks
  final web = chunk.metadata['web_search'];
  if (web != null) {
    // { stage: 'started'|'result', data: {...} }
    print('\n(web_search) ${web['stage']}: ${web['data']}');
  }

  final ci = chunk.metadata['code_interpreter'];
  if (ci != null) {
    print('\n(code_interpreter) ${ci['stage']}: ${ci['data']}');
  }
}
```

Provider note (OpenAI Responses)

- These map directly to OpenAI’s built-ins (web_search, file_search, computer_use, image_generation, code_interpreter).
- Image generation may stream URLs or base64 media; the example prints text while media arrives as `LinkPart` or `DataPart`.

Advanced configuration

- For provider-specific tuning (e.g., file/web search filters), supply per-tool config on `OpenAIResponsesChatOptions`.

```dart
import 'package:dartantic_ai/dartantic_ai.dart';
final agent = Agent(
  'openai-responses:gpt-4o',
  chatModelOptions: OpenAIResponsesChatOptions(
    serverSideTools: const {OpenAIServerSideTool.webSearch},
    webSearchConfig: const WebSearchConfig(
      siteFilter: 'site:developer.apple.com',
    ),
  ),
);
```

Why not callbacks?

Server-side tools are already executed by the provider and feed the model directly. Callbacks are not required for model quality. Metadata is exposed purely for product UX, analytics, and compliance.
