title: "Automatic Retry"
description: "Built-in retry logic handles temporary rate limits and failures."

Model provider endpoints can be busy places; sometimes an LLM request will time
out. When that happens, dartantic will invoke its built-in retry logic to handle
temporary rate limits and failures.

## Zero Configuration

The HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" client error response status code indicates
that the client has sent too many requests within a given time period. This
mechanism, known as "rate limiting," is employed by servers to prevent overload,
ensure fair resource usage, and mitigate potential abuse or denial-of-service
attacks. When dartantic gets a 429 response, it will retry automatically without
you having to do anything:

```dart
final agent = Agent('openai');

// Automatically retries on 429 errors
final result = await agent.send('Hello!');
```

## Timing Strategy

Dartantic will use an incremental backoff algorithm along with a random "jitter"
to see if it can get a response to go through.

```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: 1s + jitter
Attempt 3: 2s + jitter  
Attempt 4: 4s + jitter
```
