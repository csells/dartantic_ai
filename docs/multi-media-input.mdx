Because sometimes words aren't enoughâ€”your AI needs to see what's in your fridge too.

## Local Files

You can attach local files to prompts you send to your agent:

```dart
// Using cross_file for cross-platform support
import 'package:cross_file/cross_file.dart';

final agent = Agent('openai');

// Text file
final bioFile = XFile.fromData(
  await File('bio.txt').readAsBytes(), 
  path: 'bio.txt',
);
final result = await agent.send(
  'Can you summarize the attached file?',
  attachments: [await DataPart.fromFile(bioFile)],
);

// Image file (the moment of truth)
final fridgeFile = XFile.fromData(
  await File('fridge.png').readAsBytes(),
  path: 'fridge.png',
);
final result = await agent.send(
  'What food do I have on hand?',
  attachments: [await DataPart.fromFile(fridgeFile)],
);
// "I see leftover pizza, expired milk, and... is that a science experiment?"

// Responses API can request richer vision detail
final responsesAgent = Agent(
  'openai-responses',
  chatModelOptions: const OpenAIResponsesChatModelOptions(
    imageDetail: ImageDetail.high,
  ),
);
await responsesAgent.send(
  'Describe the fridge image with extra detail',
  attachments: [await DataPart.fromFile(fridgeFile)],
);
```

## Download from URL

You can download data from links:

```dart
// Download and include file from URL
final urlData = await DataPart.url(
  Uri.parse('https://example.com/document.pdf'),
);
final result = await agent.send(
  'Summarize this document',
  attachments: [urlData],
);
```

## Raw Bytes

You can attach bytes you've already got in memory:

```dart
// Include raw bytes with mime type
final bytes = Uint8List.fromList([/* your data */]);
final rawData = DataPart(
  bytes: bytes,
  mimeType: 'application/pdf',
);
final result = await agent.send(
  'Process this data',
  attachments: [rawData],
);
```

## Web URLs

You an attach links w/o downloading:

```dart
// Direct URL reference (OpenAI)
final result = await agent.send(
  'Describe this image',
  attachments: [
    LinkPart(Uri.parse('https://example.com/image.jpg')),
  ],
);
```

## Multiple Attachments

You can mix and match:

```dart
// Mix text and images
final result = await agent.send(
  'Based on the bio and fridge contents, suggest a meal',
  attachments: [
    await DataPart.fromFile(bioFile),
    await DataPart.fromFile(fridgeFile),
  ],
);
```
