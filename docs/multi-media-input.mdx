title: Multi-media Input
---

Dartantic supports the inclusion of files, images, and other media as
attachments to your prompts. Both OpenAI and Gemini providers can process
multimedia content alongside text.

## DataPart - Local Files, URL Downloads and Raw Bytes

Use `DataPart.stream()` to include local files (text, images, etc.):

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:dartantic_ai/dartantic_ai.dart';

void main() async {
  final agent = Agent('google');

  // Text file
  final file = File('bio.txt');
  final response1 = await agent.run(
    'Can you summarize the attached file?',
    attachments: [await DataPart.stream(file.openRead(), name: file.path)],
  );
  print(response1.output);

  // Image file
  final image = File('cupboard.jpg');
  final response2 = await agent.run(
    'What food do I have on hand?',
    attachments: [await DataPart.stream(image.openRead(), name: image.path)],
  );
  print(response2.output);
}
```

> **Note:** `DataPart.stream` replaces the previous `DataPart.file` constructor. This change improves compatibility with web and WASM platforms, where direct file access is not available. Use a stream and provide a name for best results.

In addition, you can use `DataPart.url()` to download a file from a URL and the
standard `DataPart` constructor to pass in raw bytes and a mime type.

Different providers have different limits on the size of data that you can
upload, depending on the model, your billing plan and, of course, royal station
(Dukes? large files. Earls? Not so much...)

## LinkPart - Web URLs

Use `LinkPart()` to reference web images:

```dart
import 'package:dartantic_ai/dartantic_ai.dart';

void main() async {
  final agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o');

  final imageUrl = Uri.parse(
    'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/'
    'Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-'
    'Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg'
  );

  final response = await agent.run(
    'Can you describe this image?',
    attachments: [LinkPart(imageUrl)],
  );
  print(response.output);
}
```

Different providers may have varying support for specific file types and web
URLs. At the time of this writing, Gemini requires files uploaded to Google AI
File Service for LinkPart URLs.

You can find a working example in
