title: Agentic Behavior - Multi-Step Tool Calling
---

A key feature of an "agent" is its ability to perform multi-step reasoning.
Instead of just calling one tool and stopping, an agent can use the result of
one tool to inform its next action, chaining multiple tool calls together to
solve a complex problem without requiring further user intervention.

Dartantic AI uses multi-step tool calling exclusively. The agent will loop,
calling tools as many times as it needs to fully resolve the user's prompt. It
can use the output from one tool as the input for another, creating sophisticated
chains of execution.

## Example: Multi-Step Tool Calling

Let's see multi-step tool calling in action. We'll set up some tools and a prompt that requires chaining multiple tool calls together.

```dart
// Two simple tools for our agent
final tools = [
  Tool(
    name: 'get_current_time',
    description: 'Get the current date and time.',
    onCall: (_) async => {'time': '2025-06-21T10:00:00Z'},
  ),
  Tool(
    name: 'find_events',
    description: 'Find events for a specific date.',
    inputSchema: {
      'type': 'object',
      'properties': {'date': {'type': 'string'}},
      'required': ['date'],
    }.toSchema(),
    onCall: (_) async => {'events': ['Team Meeting at 11am']},
  ),
];

// A prompt that requires a two-step tool chain
const prompt = 'What events do I have today? Please find the current date first.';

// A helper to print the message history nicely
void printMessages(List<Message> messages) {
  for (var i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
    final m = messages[i];
    print('Message #${i + 1}: role=${m.role}');
    for (final part in m.parts) {
      print('  - $part');
    }
  }
  print('---');
}
```

### Multi-Step Execution

The agent automatically calls the first tool, gets the date, and then immediately uses that date to call the second tool to complete the user's request.

```dart
// Create an agent with multi-step tool calling
final agent = Agent('openai', tools: tools);
final response = await agent.run(prompt);
print('--- Multi-Step Tool Calling ---');
printMessages(response.messages);
```

The resulting message history shows the full, two-step reasoning chain:

```
--- Multi-Step Tool Calling ---
Message #1: role=user
  - TextPart(text: "What events do I have today? Please find the current date first.")
Message #2: role=model
  - ToolPart(kind: call, id: ..., name: get_current_time, arguments: {})
Message #3: role=model
  - ToolPart(kind: result, id: ..., name: get_current_time, result: {time: 2025-06-21T10:00:00Z})
Message #4: role=model
  - ToolPart(kind: call, id: ..., name: find_events, arguments: {date: 2025-06-21})
Message #5: role=model
  - ToolPart(kind: result, id: ..., name: find_events, result: {events: [Team Meeting at 11am]})
Message #6: role=model
  - TextPart(text: "You have one event today: a Team Meeting at 11am.")
---
```

This multi-step approach ensures the agent can fully resolve complex requests without requiring additional user intervention.
