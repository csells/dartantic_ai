title: Thinking Metadata
description: "Surface model reasoning without forcing it into the conversation transcript."

Some providers expose a separate "thinking" channel that streams the model's
reasoning metadata alongside the normal message output. This lets you display or
inspect the model's inner monologue without sending it back to the model or to
end users who just want the final answer.

Both **OpenAI Responses** and **Anthropic** support thinking metadata. The
generated metadata is provider-agnostic, so additional providers can adopt it
later without requiring any changes to your code.

## Enable Thinking

### OpenAI Responses

Enable thinking by setting the `reasoningSummary` parameter to
`OpenAIReasoningSummary.detailed`:

```dart
final agent = Agent(
  'openai-responses:gpt-5',
  chatModelOptions: const OpenAIResponsesChatModelOptions(
    reasoningSummary: OpenAIReasoningSummary.detailed,
  ),
);

final result = await agent.send('In one sentence, how does quicksort work?');
final thinking = result.metadata['thinking'] as String?;

if (thinking != null && thinking.isNotEmpty) {
  print('[[${thinking.trim()}]]');
}
print(result.output);
```

### Anthropic

Enable thinking with explicit token budget control:

```dart
final agent = Agent(
  'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5',
  chatModelOptions: const AnthropicChatOptions(
    maxTokens: 16000,
    thinking: ThinkingConfig.enabled(
      type: ThinkingConfigEnabledType.enabled,
      budgetTokens: 10000,  // Must be at least 1024 and less than maxTokens
    ),
  ),
);

final result = await agent.send('In one sentence, how does quicksort work?');
final thinking = result.metadata['thinking'] as String?;

if (thinking != null && thinking.isNotEmpty) {
  print('[[${thinking.trim()}]]');
}
print(result.output);
```

### Key Points

- The reasoning stream is emitted through `ChatResult.metadata['thinking']`
- Thinking metadata doesn't appear in `ChatMessage.metadata`
- Metadata is typically not fed back to the model, so you control where (or if)
  it is displayed
- **Important**: When using Anthropic with tool calls, thinking blocks are
  automatically preserved in conversation history as required by their API. This
  increases token costs on subsequent turns.

## Streaming Thinking

```dart
final history = <ChatMessage>[];
var stillThinking = true;
stdout.write('[[');

final thinkingBuffer = StringBuffer();
await for (final chunk in agent.sendStream(
  'In one sentence: how does quicksort work?',
)) {
  final thinking = chunk.metadata['thinking'] as String?;
  final hasThinking = thinking != null && thinking.isNotEmpty;
  final hasText = chunk.output.isNotEmpty;

  if (hasThinking) {
    thinkingBuffer.write(thinking);
    stdout.write(thinking);
  }

  if (hasText) {
    if (stillThinking) {
      stillThinking = false;
      stdout.writeln(']]\n');
    }
    stdout.write(chunk.output);
  }

  history.addAll(chunk.messages);
}

stdout.writeln('\n');
```

The stream delivers reasoning deltas incrementally, so you can render a live
"thought bubble" while the model is working. Each chunk may include text output,
thinking metadata, or both.
