title: Streaming Output
---

`Agent.runStream` returns a `Stream<AgentResponse>`, allowing you to process
output as it is generated by the LLM in real time. This is useful for displaying
partial results to users or for handling long responses efficiently.

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:dartantic_ai/dartantic_ai.dart';

void main() async {
  final agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o');
  final stream = agent.runStream('Tell me a short story about a brave robot.');
  await for (final response in stream) {
    stdout.write(response.output); // Output: Once upon a time, there was a brave robot named... (streaming in real-time)
  }
}
```
