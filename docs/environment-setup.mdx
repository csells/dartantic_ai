title: Environment Setup
---

Set API keys via environment variables and the providers automatically discover
them.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Set your API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AI..."

# Use without configuration
dart run
```

```dart
// Keys are auto-discovered
final agent = Agent('openai');
final result = await agent.send('Hello!');
```

## Platform Environment Variables

| Provider | Variable | Required |
|----------|----------|----------|
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ✅ |
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | ✅ |
| Google | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | ✅ |
| Mistral | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | ✅ |
| Cohere | `COHERE_API_KEY` | ✅ |
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | ✅ |
| Together AI | `TOGETHER_API_KEY` | ✅ |
| Lambda | `LAMBDA_API_KEY` | ✅ |
| Ollama | None (local) | ❌ |

## Agent Environment

The environment provided by your platform is a fall-back mechanism and it's not
always available. You can also set the environment variables on the `Agent`
itself:

```dart
// Set programmatically
Agent.environment['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'sk-...';
Agent.environment['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'] = 'sk-ant-...';
```

The agent's environment is the default place for providers to look for API keys
and it's always available. It's useful for loading from .env files, your cloud
vendor's secrets database, [Flutter's compile-time constant
mechanism](https://dart.dev/language/variables#final-and-const) or wherever fine
API keys are grown.
